# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# uniformPieceSizes = UniformPieceSize.create([{name: 'PP'},{name: 'P'},{name: 'M'},{name: 'G'},{name: 'GG'},{name: 'G3'},{name: 'G4'},{name: 'G5'},{name: '33'},{name: '34'},{name: '35'},{name: '36'},{name: '37'},{name: '38'},{name: '39'},{name: '40'},{name: '41'},{name: '42'},{name: '43'},{name: '44'}])
